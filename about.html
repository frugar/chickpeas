  <p class="contenttxt"> <strong>Chickpeas is a small independent farm in sunny Central Florida. </strong>
    Our founder, Noah, was raised on an organic orchard in Portland, Oregon. After graduating with a
    degree in agriculture from UCF, Noah decided to settle in central Florida and establish his own organic
    farm. Together with a tight nit team of friends, we operate a functional, sustainable homestead and
    support ourselves by selling organic produce, berries, and pasture-raised eggs. We are committed to
    producing a diverse yield of crops, grown using sustainable, organic principles and will promise to
    donate any excess to local food banks.<br>

    <br> <strong>We never use any chemical pesticides, fertilizers, or other kind of poison anywhere
    on our property. </strong>We practice earth friendly growing methods such as crop rotation,
    composting our own fertilizers, hand weeding our garden areas, and irrigating with
    collected rainwater. Our farm is licensed by the state of Florida, inspected by
    the USDA, and Certified HumaneÂ®. <br>

    <br><strong>Our customers are our greatest asset and most trusted partners. </strong>Together we
    look forward to exploring an array of organic vegetables in an ongoing experimental journey.
    Every year, we learn from the successes and failures of previous seasons and use that knowledge to
    shape our path forward. Your feedback and support is critical in this process, so if you have
    an opinion, share it!<br>

    <br>We can be found in the fields almost every day because we love what we do. </p>
