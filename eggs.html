  <h1> PASTURE RAISED EGGS </h1>

    <p class="contenttxt"><strong> We believe our eggs taste so good because our pasture-raised
      hens live happy, healthy lives! </strong>Our girls’ fresh-air lifestyle is full of foraging
      and feasting on natural goodness, which shines through in every egg. If you’ve never
      cracked open a pasture-raised egg, your culinary life is about to change.</p>
    <p class="contenttxt"><strong> Why are better tasting eggs important? </strong>Ask a chef and the
      first thing she’ll tell you is that the ingredients you use are the most important
      determinant of the quality of the final dish.  Eggs are a pretty important ingredient.
      Not only do they show up in your scrambles, omelets and quiches, but they also appear
      in your healthy grain bowls, carbonaras and Caesars, and in your cakes and custards.
      Better eggs make everything else better (even if it’s just sunny side up on toast).</p>

    <p class="contenttxt"><strong>Our pasture-raised eggs are laid by hens that spend their days outdoors roaming the
    pastures as they please.</strong> Our pasture-raised girls get a minimum of 108 square feet
    EACH – unlike free range and cage-free birds that have far less freedom.  Free range
    hens typically get a minimum of 2 square feet per bird and have limited access to
    the outdoors. Cage-free birds get a minimum of 1.2 square foot per bird and may rarely,
    if ever, see the sunlight. We make sure our girls have access to fresh air and
    sunshine year-round. Our choices of how to treat our hens—what to plant on farm, what
    not to spray, what to feed and how to care for our hens—is at the foundation of
    Chickpes Farm.</p>

    <p class="contenttxt"> <strong> Certified Humane® is considered the gold standard in
      animal welfare.</strong> Certified Humane® standards are set by a scientific committee
      of internationally renowned animal scientists, veterinarians and researchers. Our farm
      undergoes an extensive application, inspection and verification process
      each year to ensure that we meet or exceed all of the Certified Humane® standards
      for pasture-raised laying hens. We’re proud to carry the Certified Humane® seal on
      all of our cartons. <strong>Read more about Certified Humane® standards for hens
